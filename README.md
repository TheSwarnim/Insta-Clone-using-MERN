# Insta-Clone-using-MERN
- This is an Instagram Clone which is build on MERN
- I've used React for frontend development to make a single page application
- Materialize-CSS, Material-UI is used to give some external css to make UI better
- For backend I've used expressjs which is build on nodejs
- For giving database support I've used mongoose to connect to MongoDB nosql database easily
- I've also used some more npm libraries such as bycryptjs, jsonwebtoken, etc for user privacy.
